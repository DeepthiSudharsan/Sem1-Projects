## EQUILIBRIUM OF A RIGID BODY IN 2D (USING OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING CONCEPTS)

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The hydraulic actuator BC exerts a force at C that points along the line from B to C. Treat A as a pin support. The mass of the suspended load is W. if the actuator BC can
exert a maximum force of P, what is the smallest permissible value of Œ± ? W can vary from 2000 kg to 8000 kg and P can vary from 60 kN to 180 kN.

## TWO CASES INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT

* Case 1: We will give the value for ùõº and weight of the block to find the value of p. 
* Case 2: We will give the value for p and weight of the block to find the value of ùõº
